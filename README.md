# We Are Made of Stars: A Multi‑Scale Gradient‑Field Approach to Microscopy Data Visualization

We introduce _Made of Stars_, a novel visualization that fuses flocking algorithms, synchronized firing events, and gradient‑derived force fields to produce dynamic, biologically meaningful depictions of large‑scale microscopy data.
